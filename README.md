# MACHINE LEARNING BASED CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR PREDICTION USING CHURN ANALYSIS
Customer churn analysis and prediction in telecom sector is an issue now a days because itâ€™s very important for telecommunication industries to analyse behaviours of various customer to predict which customers are about to leave the subscription from telecom company.In a telecommunication company, the individual who has opted service from a firm is referred to as Churn.

## Steps involved in Model Deployment
* Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Preprocessing.
* Feature Engineering.
* Feature Selection (SelectKBest)
* Fit into Algorithm (ML Algorithm)
* Hyper Parameter Tuning (RandomSearchCV)
* Dump model (Pickle)
* Creating Web Application using Flask
* Deployed in Web using heroku platform

## This project requires Python and the following packages are in below:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Scipy
* Imblearn
* Counter
* Flask

## How To Run
In this project, First download dataset 'Telco-Customer-churn.csv' Then open your command prompt and run this code
```
$ pip install jupyterlab
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
By doing this,all packages needed in this project are automatically installed on your machine.
Now Download app.py files and run TelecomCustomerChurn.ipynb files into your machine And some inputs to check our model and Its accuracy of prediction.
